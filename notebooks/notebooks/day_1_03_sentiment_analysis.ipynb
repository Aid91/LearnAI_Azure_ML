You will gain hands-on experience with essential steps of a model development using MLlib, which has has the goal to make machine learning scalable and easy. \n\nAt a high level, MLlib provides tools such as:\n- ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering\n- Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection\n- Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines\n- Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines\n- Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.\n\nIn this lab, we will cover:\n- Splitting of data for training and testing\n- Applying Transformers to data frames\n- Fitting Estimators to our data\n- Creating and executing a ML Pipeline\n- Model Evaluation.\n\n## Use case\n\nWe will take a break from our usual use-case of predictive maintenance, to instead learn how to use these features and tools by solving a common task in *Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis*.  Our dataset contains roughly 6,000 tweets about climate change.  Based on the text of the tweet, we want to predict if the tweets supports the existence of climate change.\n\nOther applications of Sentiment Analysis:\n- Detecting negative affect in customers who are calling an automated customer hotline\n- Agreggating reviews of retail products into an overall rating for each product\n\n> The dataset was made available [here](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/) by Kent Cavender-Bares."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Initialize Notebook Environment\n\nWe start by loading the parquet file we created in the previous lab."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"../includes/mnt_blob\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load data"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gwDF = spark.read.csv(\"/mnt/data/1377884570_tweet_global_warming.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\ndisplay(gwDF)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>tweet</th><th>existence</th><th>existence.confidence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Global warming report urges governments to act|BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The world faces increased hunger and ..

Hands-on lab (advanced!)\n\nThe first pipeline was using a very basic approach to feature engineering: It tokenized tweets into individual words, removed stop words, and counted for each word how often it appeared in each tweet.\n\nLet's try interesting: We use [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) to create [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding). Rather then relying simply on the individual words in each tweet, we will create a semantic representation that tells us what topic were touched on in each tweet. Intituitively, this will tell us a bit about what the person had in mind when writing the tweet.\n\nIn the following cell, do the following:\n- Define a `Word2vec` object and fit it to the `removedStopWordsDF` DataFrame. This will return a `Word2VecModel`.
