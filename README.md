# LearnAI - CustomAI Airlift

## Introduction

Welcome to the LearnAI training for custom AI delivered as part of our Partner AI Airlifts.

The material presented here is a deep-dive which combine real-world data science scenarios with many different technologies including Azure Databricks (ADB), Azure Machine Learning (AML) Services and Azure DevOps, with the goal of creating, deploying and maintaining end-to-end data science and AI solutions.

## Use-Cases

We have two different use-cases (scenarios)

### 1. Anomaly Detection in structured data 

- The data scientist has been tasked to develop a predictive maintenance (PdM) solution for a large set of production machines on a manufacturing floor.  

- The data scientist was asked to create a PdM solution that is executed weekly, to develop a maintenance schedule for the next week. 

- Previous experience suggests that anomalies in the telemetry data collected on each machine are indicative of impending catastrophic failures. The data scientist was therefore asked to include anomaly detection in their solution. 

- The organization also asked for a real-time anomaly detection service, to enable immediate machine inspection before the beginning of the next maintenance cycle.  

### 2. Anomaly Detection in *un*structured data

- This content covers how to use a deep recurrent neural network to detect anomalous behavior in videos.

## Pre-requisites

You will need this basic knowledge:

1. An Azure Subscription (unless provided to you).
2. Knowledge of basic data science and machine learning concepts. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNV9EqwXCpw) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBDSBInvz08) you'll find short introductory material.
3. Moderate skills in coding with Python and machine learning using Python. A good place to start is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rf4fZDQ0yw&list=PLjgj6kdf_snaw8QnlhK5f3DzFDFKDU5f4).
4. Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks and/or Databricks Notebooks, see here. For hands-on experience, log into [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) (Azure subscription required) and follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/tutorial-create-run-jupyter-notebook).
5. Familiarity with Azure Databricks, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxyUy1bZ9mk&t=1351s). If you are not provided with a managed lab environment, then follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment) for creating one.
