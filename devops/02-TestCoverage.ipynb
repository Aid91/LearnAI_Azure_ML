    "# Test Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing tests for your application lets you check that the code you wrote works the way you expect. `pytest-cov` is a mature full-featured framework to write your tests efficiently and producting coverage reports. It removes all the overheads for creating tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should test as much of your code as possible. The closer you get to 100% coverage, the more comfortable you can be that making a change won’t unexpectedly change other behavior. However, 100% coverage doesn’t guarantee that your application doesn’t have bugs. Despite this, code and test coverage is an important tool to use during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code coverage is a measurement of how many lines/blocks of your code are executed while the automated tests are running. With testing, code coverage indicates how well your test set is covering your source code (i.e. to what extent is the source code covered by the set of test cases). Having \"100% code coverage\" doesn't mean everything is tested completely. While it means every line of code is tested, it doesn't mean they are tested under every situation."
