Serverless computing, also known as function as a service, aims to eliminate infrastructure considerations for the user. With serverless, a user can simply create and upload code, and then define the triggers or events that will execute the code. \n\nTriggers are what cause a function to run. In this workshop, we will develop a HTTP trigger that lets you invoke a function with an HTTP request. You can use an HTTP trigger to build serverless APIs and respond to webhooks. The release pipeline will then invoke a HTTP triggered function in an Azure function app and parse the response."

We will first use npm init command to create a new _package.json_ using console:\n\n````javascript\n    npm init --yes\n````\n\nA _package.json_ file can be described as a manifest of your project that includes the packages and applications it depends on, information about its unique source control, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author. Here's an example of how these fields would look in a package.json file:\n\n![npmInit](images/npmInit.png)\n\n````json\n{\n    \"name\": \"projectname\", // The name of your project\n    \"version\": \"0.1.23\", // The version of your project\n    \"description\": \"Snippet about your project\", // The description of your project\n    \"main\": \"index.js\"\n    \"license\": \"MS\" // The license of your project\n}\n````\n\n2.

We will be using it to get responses from _Azure DevOps Services REST APIs_ in our function. The warnings in red can be ignored.\n\n3. Replace the content of `index.js` in the Azure Function portal with the content of `test_analysis.js`. Update the following parameters in the code:\n\n````javascript\n    var url = \"https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/test/runs?api-version=5.0\"\n    var username = \"{username}\"\n    var password = \"{personal_access_token}\"\n````\n\n| Name   |      Description      |\n|----------|-------------|\n| _organization_ |  The name of the Azure DevOps organization |\n| _project_ |    Project name   |\n| _username_ | Username associated with the Azure Devops account |\n| _password_ | Personal access token. This can be passed in the authorization header to access REST APIs. Refer to the next section on how to create Personal Access Token |"
