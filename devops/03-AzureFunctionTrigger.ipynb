    "Azure Functions is Microsoft's serverless computing service. Traditional application development demands a consideration of the underlying IT infrastructure. Serverless computing, also known as function as a service, aims to eliminate infrastructure considerations for the user. With serverless, a user can simply create and upload code, and then define the triggers or events that will execute the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers are what cause a function to run. In this workshop, we will develop a HTTP trigger that lets you invoke a function with an HTTP request. You can use an HTTP trigger to build serverless APIs and respond to webhooks. The release pipeline will then invoke a HTTP triggered function in an Azure function app and parse the response."
