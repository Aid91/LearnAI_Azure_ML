Please be careful to store you progress so that you will be able to continue to work on your solution after the Airlift ended. Make sure to take note of the **submission deadline**.\n\nWe ask you to work in groups of 2-3 attendees.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"fe7f86c0-4da0-4da2-8007-006f2112e360"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":190158237274603,"guid":"278a9018-4075-464a-a70e-cb3fad11d709","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.0,"command":"%md-sandbox\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/6961/logos/header.png\"/>\n\n## Humpback Whale Identification\n\n### Can you identify a whale by its tail?\n\n**Summary (by Kaggle):** After centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still have a hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle to compete every day with the industrial fishing industry for food. To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized. In this competition, you’re challenged to build an algorithm to identify individual whales in images. You’ll analyze Happywhale’s database of over 25,000 images, gathered from research institutions and public contributors. By contributing, you’ll help to open rich fields of understanding for marine mammal population dynamics around the globe. Note, this competition is similar in nature to <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground\">this competition </a> with an expanded and updated dataset. We'd like to thank <a href=\"https://happywhale.com/\">Happywhale</a> for providing this data and problem. Happywhale is a platform that uses image process algorithms to let anyone to submit their whale photo and have it automatically identified.\n","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"2f7c865f-7f1e-4eb0-b3ff-531d229d6a2d"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":190158237274610,"guid":"0ab0c4e7-f7d6-4eeb-a3ab-5ae8149bd5eb","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.0,"command":"%md-sandbox\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/11000/logos/header.png\">\n\n# LANL Earthquake Prediction\n\n## Can you predict upcoming laboratory earthquakes?\n\n**Summary (by Kaggle):** Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when\nthe event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.\n\nIn this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, you’ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data. If this challenge is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure. This challenge is hosted by  <a href=\"https://www.lanl.gov/\">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> which enhances national security by ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and global security concerns.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"49032c17-2eee-4e8f-8152-3c4819bd2dd2"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":190158237274611,"guid":"2d59bc0b-016b-4ee9-8bd2-6795a53e4ce0","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":4.0,"command":"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"690a8f05-d716-4efc-b528-75d94c2af040"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":190158237274612,"guid":"fccf6d51-f390-430c-98f3-42f279ec4750","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.5,"command":"%md\n\nThe challenges are described in more detail here:\n\n1. **[Deep Learning - Humpback Whale Identification]($./04a_humpback_whales)**\n1. **[Classic ML  - Earthquake Prediction]($./04b_earthquakes)**","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"d6971068-5789-46a8-bc79-31a616f58f4c"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":190158237274613,"guid":"1e1abd6e-c729-41d8-a4a5-97be5c114254","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":0.5,"command":"%md\n\n# Hackathon Challenge","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":{"type":"html","data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","arguments":{},"addedWidgets":{},"removedWidgets":[],"datasetInfos":[]},"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":1547515655033,"submitTime":1547515654991,"finishTime":1547515655057,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"wopauli@microsoft.com","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"ff6ac9ab-9104-46c3-982d-8cbe14590c3e"}],"dashboards":[],"guid":"fb67d742-5e10-4817-befc-71012399ba30","globalVars":{},"iPythonMetadata":null,"inputWidgets":{}}
