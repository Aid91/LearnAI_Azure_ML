You will gain hands-on experience with essential steps of a model development using MLlib, which has has the goal to make machine learning scalable and easy. \n\nAt a high level, MLlib provides tools such as:\n- ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering\n- Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection\n- Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines\n- Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines\n- Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.\n\nIn this lab, we will cover:\n- Splitting of data for training and testing\n- Applying Transformers to data frames\n- Fitting Estimators to our data\n- Creating and executing a ML Pipeline\n- Model Evaluation.\n\nWe will learn how to use these features and tools by solving a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis.  Our dataset contains roughly 50,000 movie reviews from the internet movie database (IMDB).  Each entry is a movie review written in the English language, as well as the author's rating of the movie on a scale from 1 to 10.  Based on the text of the review, we want to predict if the rating is \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n\nOther applications of Sentiment Analysis:\n- Detecting negative affect in customers who are calling an automated customer hotline\n- Agreggating reviews of retail products into an overall rating for each product"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Initialize Notebook Environment\n\nAs usual we start by mounting our data and setting up our environment."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"../includes/mnt_blob\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"../includes/setup_env\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["reviewsDF = spark.read.parquet(\"/mnt/data/imdb/imdb_ratings_50k.parquet\")\nreviewsDF.createOrReplaceTempView(\"reviews\")\ndisplay(reviewsDF)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Hands-on lab"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["What does the distribution of scores look like?\n\nHINT: Use `count()`"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\n\n-- Put your solution here"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\n\n-- Maximize this cell to see the solution\n\nselect rating, count(*) from reviews group by rating order by rating;"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### End of Lab"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The authors of this dataset have removed the \"neutral\" ratings, which they defined as a rating of 5 or 6."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Train-Test Split\n\nWe'll split our data into training and test samples.
