    "* Knowing how to mount your data in Azure Blob storage.\n",
    "* Understanding the relationship between between DataFrames, Datasets, and RDDs.\n",
    "* Using *actions*, such as `show()`, `display()`, and `count()`.\n",
    "* Using the *transformations*, such as `limit()`, `select()`, and `drop()`.\n",
    "* Understand the difference between `actions` and `transformations`.\n",
    "* Know how to find documentation on Spark.\n",

Another thing to understand is that you can \"pile up\" transformations, one after the other.\n",
