# LearnAI - CustomAI Airlift
This repository offers content for a three day deep-dive workshop on anomaly detection and predictive maintenance by integrating Azure Databricks with Azure Machine Learning. However, the content can also be utilized in the form of a one day workshop using the below agenda.

This material should enable you to learn how to combine the strengths of Azure Databricks (ADB) for data wrangling and ML model building and training on big data, with the strengths of Azure Machine Learning (AML) services for ML Experimentation, Management and Deployment.

For this purpose, we will use a real-world scenario for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance on factory floors. This use-case scenario was selected based on popular demand by the field, and its applicability across industry verticals.

### Agenda
